🚀 Key Business Problems Solved

Inventory Oversell Prevention

Redis-based locking + atomic SKU decrement strategy

Ensures order processing consistency under high traffic

Fast API Response under Load

Multi-level cache strategy

Avoids database saturation during flash events

Secure API Layer

Spring Boot + JWT + RBAC

Protects endpoints from unauthorized access
