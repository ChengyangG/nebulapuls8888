Nebula Pulse E-Commerce Platform

📖 Overview

Nebula Pulse is a production-grade, full-stack e-commerce ecosystem designed for high performance and scalability. It features a microservices-ready architecture with a robust backend, a comprehensive admin dashboard, and a responsive customer storefront.

This project demonstrates the ability to build complex systems handling high-concurrency orders, secure authentication, and real-time data management—core competencies for modern Full-Stack development.

✨ Key Features

🛡 Backend (nebula-commerce)

High-Performance Architecture: Built with Spring Boot for rapid development and microservice scalability.

Security First: Implemented Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless, secure stateless authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Data Persistence: Utilizes MyBatis Plus for efficient ORM and dynamic SQL handling with MySQL.

Caching Strategy: Integrated Redis for caching hot data (product details, sessions) to reduce DB load and improve response times.

High Concurrency: Optimized order processing logic to handle flash sales and high-traffic scenarios safely.

🖥 Admin Dashboard (nebula-admin)

Modern SPA: Developed with Vue 3 (Composition API) and TypeScript for type-safe, maintainable frontend code.

State Management: Uses Pinia for centralized store management across components.

Dynamic Routing: Permission-based routing (Async Routes) ensuring users only see what they are authorized to access.

Data Visualization: Integrated charts and tables for real-time sales monitoring and user analytics.

🛍 Storefront (nebula-store)

Mobile-First Design: Responsive layout optimized for mobile shopping experiences using Vant UI.

Smooth UX: Fast page loads via Vite and optimized asset bundling.

Complete Flow: Full user journey implementation: Browsing -> Cart -> Checkout -> Payment Mock -> Order History.
